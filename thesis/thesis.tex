\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
\thispagestyle{empty}
\pagestyle{empty}
First, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my thesis supervisor, Professor Maryline Laurent, for her guidance throughout my thesis, for all the fruitful discussions that we had, and especially for her patience. Her wide knowledge and her logical way of thinking have been of great value for me. I would also like to thank her for being attentive towards me and providing me with invaluable encouragements when I was lost and could not find my way.\\

My gratitude goes to Sir Tim Berners-Lee for having invited me to work under his guidance at MIT, as well as for his incredible work which inspired me to pursue this thesis.\\

I am very thankful to Olivier Berger, research engineer in the Informatics Department of TELECOM SudParis, for our extensive collaboration and for accepting to be member of the examination jury.\\

Many thanks go towards my colleagues and friends, from TELECOM SudParis and beyond, which supported me during all these years. Among them I would like to mention Aymen Boudguiga and Collins Mtita, with whom I have shared more than just an office.\\

I would finally like to thank my family for their continuous love and support. A special thank you goes to my wife Raluca for her love and constant support, for all the late nights and early mornings, and for keeping me sane over the past few months. Thank you for everything, but most of all, thank you for being my best friend. I owe you everything.\\

This work has been funded entirely by TELECOM SudParis, member of group Institut Mines-TELECOM.

\chapter*{Abstract}

Ensuring personal data ownership and interoperability for decentralized social Web applications is currently a debated topic, especially when taking into consideration the aspects of privacy and access control. Since the user's data are such an important asset of the current business models for most social Websites, companies have no incentive to share data among each other or to offer users real ownership of their own data in terms of control and transparency of data usage. We have concluded therefore that it is important to improve the social Web in such a way that it allows for viable business models while still being able to provide increased data ownership and data interoperability compared to the current situation.\\

To this regard, we have focused our research on three different topics: identity, authentication and access control. First, we tackle the subject of decentralized identity by proposing a new Web standard called \textit{Web Identity and Discovery} (WebID), which offers a simple and universal identification mechanism that is distributed and openly extensible. Next, we move to the topic of authentication where we propose WebID-TLS, a decentralized authentication protocol that enables secure, efficient and user friendly authentication on the Web by allowing people to login using client certificates and without relying on Certification Authorities. We also extend the WebID-TLS protocol, offering delegated authentication and access delegation. Finally we present our last contribution, the Social Access Control Service, which serves to protect the privacy of Linked Data resources generated by users (e.g. profile data, wall posts, conversations, etc.) by applying two social metrics: the \textit{social proximity distance} and \textit{social contexts}.
